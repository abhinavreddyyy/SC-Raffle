# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users should be able to enter the raffle by paying for a ticket. 
2. Money is raised by selling numbered tickets and the ticket fees are going to be the prize the winner receives.
3. The lottery should automatically and programmatically draw a winner at random after a certain period.
4. Chainlink VRF should generate a provably random number.
5. Chainlink Automation should trigger the lottery draw regularly.# SC-Raffle
